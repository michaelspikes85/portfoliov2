          I started my professional career off in the IT industry by joining the
          Air National Guard as a Network Infrastructure Engineer in 2008. From
          there I held a number of positions in the civilian sector which
          includes running my own Information Technology and PC repair business.

          In 2017 I moved into the sales field for craft beer, spirits, and
          wine. After starting from an entry level position on a delivery truck,
          I was quickly promoted to the Sales Team within 6 months. In 2019 I
          was recruited by Rockstar Energy Drinks as a sales representative for
          the South East Georgia area. Although I enjoyed my new position, I
          felt that I wasnâ€™t living up to my potential and wanted a greater
          challenge.

          I enrolled with Georgia Tech for their Full Stack Development course
          so I could pursue a more lucrative career in a more stationary
          setting. With this 24-week intensive, project-based boot camp I
          learned a number of technologies to help kickstart my career in Web
          Development. In this boot camp I learned to work as an individual and
          as a team member on various projects playing various roles. These
          roles include front-end developer, back-end developer, database
          manager, as well as managing the project and team members overall. All
          of our learning led to a final project that was presented to the class
          along with administrators of the program.
